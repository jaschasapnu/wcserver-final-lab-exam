                <p>The NBA announced today that Chicago has been selected to host NBA All-Star 2020.  The 69th annual game will take place at the United Center, home of the six-time NBA champion Chicago Bulls, 
                    on Sunday, Feb. 16.  This will mark the third NBA All-Star in Chicago, which held the annual celebration in 1973 and 1988. During NBA All-Star 2020, the NBA will continue to celebrate its tradition and commitment to social responsibility with a full schedule of NBA Cares events.</p>

                <p>The gaps separating most 2020 NBA draft lottery prospects appear narrower than ever. But a favorite to go No. 1 overall is beginning to emerge. Early in March, the Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers and Minnesota Timberwolves own the worst records and 14.0 percent chances of landing the top pick. 
                    Debate over draft strategy taking the best talent available versus filling fit and needs is bound to ignite within these front offices plus others, including the New York Knicks, Atlanta Hawks and Chicago Bulls.</p>

                <p>The 2020 NBA offseason is going to happen but at this point, we really have no idea when. The coronavirus hiatus has pushed the league calendar back for at least a couple of months, but eventually, normalcy will resume and transactions will be re-opened. 
                    That includes free agency, which normally kicks off in early July but could be pushed to later into the summer, or even the fall. </p>

                <p>Four players who helped define the 2000s and 2010s in the NBA headline a star-studded 2020 Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame nominee list. Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett and Chris Bosh are four of the 50 people nominated to join the Hall of Fame, per Tim Bontemps of ESPN.com. 
                    The finalists are set to be announced during All-Star Weekend in February and the newest class of inductees will be named in April during the Final Four.</p>
